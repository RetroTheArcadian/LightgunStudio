## Quick start

There are a few steps in order to get LightgunStudio running.
Please read and follow these steps carefully!

- Download the latest version from our releases.
- Create a folder in the root of any drive fx. "Arcade" or "Lightgun"
- Add this folder to your antivirus exceptions. (Lots of programs like TeknoParrot games will throw false positives and get quarantined or deleted)
- Unpack the LightgunStudio.zip to the folder you created. (It should be a folder called "LightgunStudio" in your folder fx. "D:\Arcade\LightgunStudio")
- Run "LightgunStudio.exe" (If you are running Windows Smart Screen it may ask you to allow)
- Follow our step by step guide to setup
- Shoot stuff!
